# Source Code

The source code of this project is broken into 2 classes and 1 main file:

- pedometer.h (an attempt at OOP)

- bluetooth.h (for simplifying bluetooth)

- main.cpp (basically has everything else)


Even though the variables are not named that well, there are many comments explaining what each section does.
