Description here
<!-- Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! -->

<!-- You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions: -->

| **Engineer** | **School** | **Area of Interest** | **Grade** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Aarav A | Stratford Preparatory | Computer Science | Incoming Sophomore

<!-- **Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.** -->

My starter project is a retro arcade console that allows the user to play classic video games like Tetris, Snake, and Space Invaders. 

# Final Milestone

Final Milestone stuff goes here

<!-- **Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:

- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE -->

# Second Milestone

Second Milestone stuff goes here

<!-- **Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:

- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone -->

# First Milestone

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:

- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project -->

# Schematics

Schematics go here

<!-- Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. -->

# Code

Code here (I assume its only the main file w/o other parts like classes)

<!-- Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. -->

Example:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

A table of the parts used on the project

<!-- Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs. -->

<!-- # Other Resources/Examples (not needed?)

One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.

- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
